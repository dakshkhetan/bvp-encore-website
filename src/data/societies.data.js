          people who share love and passion for music.

        <p>
          We love to spend time with each other and fill ours’ and others’ lives
          with sweet melodies that stay with us forever. Jam Sessions and open
          mics we organize regularly help us spread our music and make up a day
          for ourselves too. It helps us and others to relax from the hefty
          schedule of college and get through the stressful days. There is a
          healthy environment in the society where everyone learns and grows
          together as a team. Also, people here tend to become good leaders and
          gain great personality skills due to the exposure people get here.

        <p>
          The society is not limited to the college but performs at inter
          college-competitions too and has won at many of them. We have won
          competitions that are open for everyone as we participate in these
          events actively. Also, we are not here to be mistaken for a side-gig
          in college as some of the people from here, have and are making their
          careers in the music industry itself. It is a place where everyone has
          a role to play and everyone is equally important, we welcome everyone
          to this great place and enjoy the musical journey with us.
